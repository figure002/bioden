        <h1>BioDen 0.3 Documentation</h1>
        <p>Welcome! This is the documentation for BioDen 0.3, last updated 19 Feb, 2011.</p>

        <div class="section" id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction <a class="headerlink" href="#intro">&para;</a></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>BioDen is a data normalizer and transponer for files
            containing taxon biomass/density data for ecotopes. The name
            BioDen is a combination of the words biomass and density. In
            general the input file of BioDen includes a list of records
            (rows in a table) that give species name, an abundance measure
            (biomass and/or density), a sample code, the surface sampled and
            the ecotope (see <a href="#input-example">input example</a>).
            This list is transformed to a table in which the rows
            represent species (names) and the columns represent samples
            (see <a href="#output">ouput examples</a>). This
            table can serve as the input file for various programs that conduct
            species community analyses.

            <h3>Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows<sup>&reg;</sup></h3>
            <p>For Windows users, an installer is available that
            includes the BioDen package together with necessary
            pre-requisites.</p>

            <h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
            <p>GNU/Linux users can use the source package for BioDen.
            The source package doesn't contain the pre-requisites. You'll have
            to install missing requirements manually with your package manager.
            See the INSTALL file for more information.</p>

            <h2>Using BioDen <a class="headerlink" href="#using-bioden">&para;</a></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>On Windows, go to Start menu > All Programs > GiMaRIS >
            BioDen > BioDen.</p>

            <p>Linux users can just run <code>bioden.pyw</code> after
            unpacking the archive.</p>

            <p>Once bioden is started, you'll be presented with its main
            window. The main window has the following components:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Select input data file</dt>
                <dd>The CSV or XLS file containing the biomass and density
                data to be processed. This file must be in a specific
                format. This format is described in the
                <a class="headerlink" href="#input-file-format">Input
                File Format</a> section.</dd>

                <dt>Select output folder</dt>
                <dd>Select the folder to which all output files should
                be saved. The output files are described in the
                <a class="headerlink" href="#output">Output Files</a>
                section.</dd>

                <dt>Property for calculations</dt>
                <dd>The property to perform the calculations on. You have a
                choice between "biomass" and "density". Note that the input
                data file must contain data for the specified property. If
                this is not the case, this will result in an error message.</dd>

                <dt>Format for output files</dt>
                <dd>The format to save the output files in. You have a choice
                between "Comma Separated Values (.csv)" and
                "Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP (.xls)".
                Note: Excel (.xls) files support a maximum of 256 columns.
                Columns that exceed this limit won't be exported!</dd>

                <dt>Advanced Options</dt>
                <dd>Clicking this toggle button shows/hides the advanced options.</dd>

                <dt>Target sample surface:</dt>
                <dd>The sample surface used for AMBI files. Default is 0.2.</dd>

                <dt>Round values to n decimals:</dt>
                <dd>Number of decimals to round values in the output
                files to. Value "-1" (default) means do not round.</dd>

                <dt>CSV Input File Options</dt>
                <dd>Clicking this toggle button shows/hides the options for the
                CSV input file.</dd>

                <dt>Field delimiter of the input file:</dt>
                <dd>A one-character string used to separate fields in
                the input CSV file. It defaults to a semicolon (;).
                By default Excel uses the semicolon for CSV files.
                If the CSV file is exported by a different application,
                make sure this character matches the delimiter in the
                data file. You can check this by opening the
                data file in a text editor (like Notepad).</dd>

                <dt>Quote character of the input file:</dt>
                <dd>A one-character string used to separate fields in
                the input CSV file. It defaults to a double quote (").</dd>

                <dt>Process Data</dt>
                <dd>Clicking this button starts the data processing.
                While it's processing the data, a progress dialog is
                displayed. Be patient, the calculations could take some
                time to finish based on the amount of data in the data
                file.</dd>
            </dl>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="input-file-format">
            <h2>Input File Format <a class="headerlink" href="#input-file-format">&para;</a></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The input data file must be a CSV or XLS file in a specific
            format.</p>

            <P>For CSV input, the default settings for BioDen have been set for
            the format in which Excel creates CSV files. This means that
            by default BioDen expects a semicolon (;) as a field
            separator. The quote character defaults to a double quote (").
            The "CSV Input File Options" in BioDen allow you to change these
            defaults, should your input CSV file use a different field delimiter
            or quote character.</p>

            <p>BioDen also expects a format for the data stored in the CSV or
            XLS file. BioDen expects the following data format:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The first row in the CSV/XLS file must be the header.
                The header contains the column names. BioDen expects
                at least the following six columns: "compiled ecotope",
                "sample code", "standardised taxon", "density",
                "biomass", and "sample surface".</li>

                <li>BioDen isn't very strict with the column names. The
                column names aren't case sensitive. So a column with
                name "BioMass" works just as good. Also BioDen uses any
                column that <i>contains</i> any of the expected
                column names. So a column with name "Sum Of Density"
                would be used as the "density" column, because it
                contains the name "density".</li>

                <li>BioDen ignores the columns that don't match
                the expected column names. So it's alright if the input file
                contains other columns.</li>

                <li>The header row must be followed by the actual data rows.</li>

                <li>BioDen automatically corrects numbers that have been
                stored in non-English format. This means that commas
                are replaced by dots (e.g. <code>12,5</code> will be
                converted to <code>12.5</code>).</li>
            </ol>

            containing the required column names:</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>BioDen produces several output files in the specified output
            folder in the spcified format. Output files are saved in either
            CSV (Comma Separated Values) format or in XLS
            (Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP) format, and can be opened with any
            spreadsheet application (e.g. Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Excel<sup>&reg;</sup>, OpenOffice.org Calc
            <a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-output-files">&para;</a>).</p>

            <p>The output files are described below:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Raw ecotope files (<code>raw_&lt;property&gt;_&lt;ecotope&gt;.csv</code>)</dt>
                <dd>The original data is split by ecotope. So one data
                file per ecotope is exported. The non-grouped values are
                exported, but the data has been re-ordered.
                <br />
                Each column is a sample, and each row contains the abundance
                measures for a species (see
                <a href="output_raw.html">example output</a>).
                </dd>

                <dt>Grouped files (<code>grouped_&lt;property&gt;_&lt;ecotope&gt;.csv</code>)</dt>
                <dd>One data file per ecotope is exported. Each file contains
                the calculated sample groups for that ecotope. Sample groups
                were created by summing samples for that ecotope until the sum
                of the sample surfaces reached the target sample surface
                (default is 0.2) or higher. The groups have <i>not</i>
                been corrected to the exact target sample surface.
                <br />
                Each column is a sample group, and each row contains the
                abundance measures for a species (see
                <a href="output_grouped.html">example output</a>).
                </dd>

                <dt>AMBI group files (<code>ambi_&lt;property&gt;_&lt;ecotope&gt;.csv</code>)</dt>
                <dd>One data file per ecotope is exported. Each file contains
                the calculated sample groups for that ecotope. Sample groups
                were created by summing samples for that ecotope until the sum
                of the sample surfaces reached the target sample surface
                (default is 0.2) or higher. The groups have been corrected to
                the exact target sample surface. This means that each sample
                group has a surface of exactly the target sample surface.
                <br />
                Each column is a sample group, and each row contains the
                abundance measures for a species (see
                <a href="output_ambi.html">example output</a>).
                </dd>

                <dt>Representatives data file (<code>representatives_&lt;property&gt;.csv</code>)</dt>
                <dd>One data file is exported. The file contains one normalized
                sample group for each ecotope. The sample group that best
                represents the ecotope is exported. The biodiversity for
                all sample groups are calculated, and the group that comes
                closest to the median of the biodiversities is considered
                the representative sample group for an ecotope.
                <br />
                Each column contains the values from the most representative
                sample group for an ecotope, and each row contains the
                abundance measures for a species (see
                <a href="output_representatives.html">example output</a>).

        <div>
            <p>The output files created by BioDen are stored in either CSV
            format or XLS format. You can view these output files
            in any spreadsheet application (e.g. Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Excel<sup>&reg;</sup>,
            OpenOffice.org Calc).</p>

            <p>Double clicking an XLS file should open it in your spreadsheet
            application. To open a CSV file however, your spreadsheet application
            needs to know some basic information about the CSV file
            before it can view it properly. For example, it needs to know
            the character used as a field delimiter, which is a comma.
            So you need to tell your spreadsheet application
            to use the comma character as the field delimiter, along
            some other properties. Below is explained how to do this with
            the two most popular spreadsheet applications.</p>

            <h3>Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Excel<sup>&reg;</sup> 2007</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Excel<sup>&reg;</sup>.
                Make sure you have open the Excel<sup>&reg;</sup> 2007 worksheet
                that you would like to import the ouput data file into.</li>
                <li>Go to the "Data" tab.</li>
                <li>Click on the "From Text" button. This will open the
                file select browser window. Navigate to where the output
                files are stored. Then select one of the output CSV files.</li>
                <li>After selecting an output file, the "Text Import
                Wizard" window is displayed. In that window set:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Original Data Type" to "Delimited"</li>
                        <li>"File origin" to "United States"</li>
                    </ul>
                Click the "Next" button.
                </li>
                <li>In the next window that appears you need to change
                the Delimiter from Tab to Comma. Uncheck "Tab" and
                check "Comma" under "Delimiters".</li>
                <li>Press "Finish". The data from the output file
                should now be displayed in the correct columns.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>OpenOffice.org Calc</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Right-click on an output CSV file, and select
                "Open With > OpenOffice.org Calc". The "Text Import"
                window should now appear.</li>
                <li>In the Text Import window, set:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Language" to "English (USA)"</li>
                        <li>"Separator options" to "Separated by" to "Comma"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Press OK. The data from the output file
                should now be displayed in the correct columns.</li>
