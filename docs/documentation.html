        <p>Welcome to the documentation for Bioden.</p>

        <div class="section" id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction <a class="headerlink" href="#intro">&para;</a></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Bioden is a data normalizer and transponer for CSV files
            containing taxon biomass/density data for ecotopes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="requirements">
            <h2>Requirements <a class="headerlink" href="#requirements">&para;</a></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Bioden has the following third-party dependencies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.python.org/about/legal/">Python</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.gtk.org/index.php">GTK+</a></li>

                <li><a href="http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html">PyGObject</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Windows&reg; installer comes bundled with these
            dependencies. The third party tools bundled with Bioden are
            property of their individual authors and are governed by
            their individual applicable license.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;</h3>
            <p>For Windows users, an installer is available that
            includes the Bioden package together with necessary
            pre-requisites listed under <a class="headerlink" href="#requirements">Requirements</a>.</p>

            <h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
            <p>GNU/Linux users can use the source package for Bioden.
            The source package doesn't contain the listed pre-requisites
            though. You'll have to install missing requirements manually
            with your package manager.</p>

            <h2>Using Bioden <a class="headerlink" href="#using-bioden">&para;</a></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>On Windows, go to Start menu > All Programs > GiMaRIS >
            bioden > bioden.</p>

            <p>Linux users can just run <code>bioden.pyw</code> after
            unpacking the archive.</p>

            <p>Once bioden is started, you'll be presented with its main
            window. The main window has the following components:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Select input data file</dt>
                <dd>The CSV file containing the biomass and density
                data to be processed. This file must be in a specific
                format. This format is described in the
                <a class="headerlink" href="#input-file-format">Input
                File Format</a> section.</dd>

                <dt>Select output folder</dt>
                <dd>Select the folder to which all output files should
                be saved. The output file are described in the
                <a class="headerlink" href="#output">Output Files</a>
                section.</dd>

                <dt>Property for calculations</dt>
                <dd>The property to perform the calculations on. Can
                be either 'biomass' or 'density'. Note that the input
                data file must have the specified property stored.</dd>

                <dt>Advanced Options</dt>
                <dd>Clicking this toggle button shows/hides the
                advanced options.</dd>

                <dt>Field delimiter of the input file:</dt>
                <dd>A one-character string used to separate fields in
                the input CSV file. It defaults to a semicolon (;).
                By default Excel uses the semicolon for CSV files.
                If the CSV file is exported by a different application,
                make sure this character matches the delimiter in the
                data file. You can check this by opening the
                data file in a text editor (like Notepad).</dd>

                <dt>Quote character of the input file:</dt>
                <dd>A one-character string used to separate fields in
                the input CSV file. It defaults to a double quote (").</dd>

                <dt>Round values to n decimals:</dt>
                <dd>Number of decimals to round values in the output
                files to. Value "-1" (default) means do not round.</dd>

                <dt>Process Data</dt>
                <dd>Clicking this button starts the data processing.
                While it's processing the data, a progress dialog is
                displayed. Be patient, the calculations could take some
                time to finish based on the amount of data in the data
                file.</dd>
            </dl>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="input-file-format">
            <h2>Input File Format <a class="headerlink" href="#input-file-format">&para;</a></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The input data file must be a CSV file in a specific
            format. The default settings for Bioden have been set for
            the format in which Excel creates CSV files. This means that
            by default Bioden expects a semicolon (;) as a field
            separator. The quote character defaults to a double quote (").
            The Advanced Options in Bioden allow you to change these defaults,
            should your input CSV file use a different field delimiter
            or quotechar.</p>

            <p>Except for the CSV format, Bioden also expects a format
            in which the data has been stored in the CSV file. Bioden
            expects the following content format:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The first line in the CSV file must be the header.
                The header contains the column names. Bioden expects
                at least the following six columns: "compiled ecotope",
                "sample code", "standardised taxon", "density",
                "biomass", and "sample surface".</li>

                <li>Bioden isn't very strict with the column names. The
                column names aren't case sensitive. So a column with
                name "BiOmAsS" works just as good. Also Bioden uses any
                column that <i>contains</i> any of the expected
                column names. So a column with name "Sum Of Density"
                would be used as the "density" column, because it
                contains the string "density".</li>

                <li>Bioden ignores the columns that don't match
                the expected column names. So it's OK if the input file
                contains other columns.</li>

                <li>The header line must be followed by the data lines.</li>

                <li>Bioden automatically corrects numbers that have been
                stored in non-English format. This means that commas
                are replaced by dots (e.g. <code>12,5</code> will be
                converted to <code>12.5</code>).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Below is an example of an input data file in CSV format
            with a header containing all required columns:</p>

            <p>Bioden produces several output files in the specified output
            folder. All output files are saved in CSV (Comma Separated
            Values) format, and can be opened with any spreadsheet
            application (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel&reg;, OpenOffice.org Calc
            <a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-output-files">&para;</a>).</p>

            <p>The output files are described below:</p>

                <dt>Transponed ecotope files (<code>transponed_&lt;property&gt;_&lt;ecotope&gt;.csv</code>)</dt>
                <dd>The original data is split by ecotope. So one data
                file per ecotope is exported. The un-processed values are
                exported, but the data has been transponed/re-ordered.

            <p>The output files created by Bioden are stored in CSV (Comma
            Separated Values) format. You can view these output files
            in any spreadsheet application (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel&reg;,
            OpenOffice.org Calc). Your spreadsheet application however
            does need to know some basic information about the CSV file
            before it can view it properly. For example, it needs to know
            the character used as a field delimiter, which is a comma.
            So you need to tell your spreadsheet application
            to use the comma character as the field delimiter, along
            some other properties. I will explain how to do this for
            the two most popular spreadsheet applications.</p>

            <h3>Microsoft&reg; Excel&reg; 2007</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start Microsoft&reg; Excel&reg;. Make sure you have open the
                Excel&reg; 2007 worksheet that you would like to import the
                ouput data file into.</li>
                <li>Go to the "Data/Gegevens" tab.</li>
                <li>Click on the "From Text/Van text" button. This will open the
                file select browser window. Navigate to where the output
                files are stored. Then select one of the output files.
                All output files have the extension ".csv".</li>
                <li>After selecting an output file, the "Text Import
                Wizard/Wizard Text importeren" window is displayed. In
                that window set:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Original Data Type/Oorspronkelijk gegevenstype" to
                        "Delimited/Gescheiden"</li>
                        <li>"File origin/Oorspronkelijk bestand"
                        to "United States/Verenigde Staten"</li>
                    </ul>
                Click the "Next/Volgende" button.
                </li>
                <li>In the next window that appears we need to change
                the Delimiter from Tab to Comma. Uncheck "Tab" and
                check "Comma/Komma" under "Delimiters/Scheidingstekens".</li>
                <li>Press "Finish/Voltooien". The data from the output file
                should now be displayed in the correct columns.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>OpenOffice.org Calc</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the folder containing the output files.</li>
                <li>Right-click on an output file, and select
                "Open With > OpenOffice.org Calc". The "Text Import"
                window should now appear.</li>
                <li>In the Text Import window, set:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Language" to "English (USA)"</li>
                        <li>"Separator options" to "Separated by" to "Comma"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Press OK. The data from the output file
                should now be displayed in the correct columns.</li>
            </ol>
